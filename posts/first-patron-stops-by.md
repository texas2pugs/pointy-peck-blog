# The Pecking Pointe sees it's first customer.

Mr. Brownfeather pecked and cracked through seed and seed at The Pecking Pointe today. With a light breeze and sunny skies, Mr. Brownfeather gave a churp as he enjoyed a tasty meal. "These seeds are the freshest I've had in a long time! I'll be sure to return and tell my friends about this new hangout." Grapping a small seed, Mr. Brownfeather flew off with satisfied customer.
