# The Pecking Pointe serves it's first customer.

Mr. Cardibrown pecked and cracked through seed after seed at The Pecking Pointe today. With a light breeze and sunny skies, Mr. Cardibrown gave a churp as he enjoyed a savory meal.

"These seeds are the freshest I've had in a long time! The sunflower is particully tasty. I'd love to get the recipe! I'll be sure to stop by again and tell my friends about this new hangout." Grabbing a small seed for the road, Mr. Cardibrown flew off a satisfied customer.
