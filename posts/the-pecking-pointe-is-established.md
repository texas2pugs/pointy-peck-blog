# It's official!

It's official! The Pecking Pointe is now open for business. Now both locals and hungry traverlers have a new establishment to fill their bellies. Various seeds and nuts are just part of what customers can find on the menu. With a nice perch next to the bar, patrons can relax and enjoy nature while picking through an assortment of seeds aimed at delighting their taste buds.
